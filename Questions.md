**Question 17**

**Output:**

```
[[1]]
[1] "apple" "banana"

[[2]]
[1] "cherry" "date" 
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves splitting a vector into two sub-vectors based on a condition. You'll need to use subsetting and potentially the `split()` function.

**Question 18**

**Output:**

```
[1] 3 6 9 12 15
```

**Explanation:**

This question tests your understanding of vectorized operations and the use of functions like `sapply()` or `lapply()` to apply a function to each element of a vector.

**Question 19**

**Output:**

```
[1] "apple" "banana" "cherry" "date"  "apple" "banana"
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves combining elements from different parts of a list while potentially using subsetting and concatenation.

```
**Question 21**

**Output:**

```
[1] 5 4 3 2 1
```

**Explanation:**

This question requires you to reverse the order of a vector. You can use indexing and the `length()` function to achieve this.

**Question 22**

**Output:**

```
[1] 1 3 5 7 9
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves creating a sequence of odd numbers using the `seq()` function.

**Question 23**

**Output:**

```
[1] 2 4 6 8 10
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves creating a sequence of even numbers using the `seq()` function and potentially the `*` operator for multiplication.

**Question 24**

**Output:**

```
[1] 2 4 6 8 10
```

**Explanation:**

This question requires you to remove the first element from a vector and then double each remaining element. You'll need to use indexing and the `*` operator.

**Question 25**

**Output:**

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves combining two sequences of numbers using the `c()` function.

**Question 26**

**Output:**

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Explanation:**

This question requires you to repeat a sequence of numbers using the `rep()` function.

**Question 27**

**Output:**

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves creating a sequence of numbers and then sorting them in ascending order using the `sort()` function.

**Question 28**

**Output:**

```
[1] 5 4 3 2 1
```

**Explanation:**

This question involves creating a sequence of numbers and then sorting them in descending order using the `sort()` function with the `decreasing = TRUE` argument.

**Question 29**

**Output:**

```
[[1]]
[1] 1 2 3

[[2]]
[1] 4 5 6

[[3]]
[1] 7 8 9
```

**Explanation:**

This question requires you to split a vector into smaller sub-vectors using subsetting and potentially the `list()` function.

**Question 30**

**Output:**

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
